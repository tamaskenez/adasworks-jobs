Software Engineer - Navigation SDK
==================================

The Navigenie team at AdasWorks develops a navigation SDK which runs on all
major platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Linux).
The SDK is backed by a database and data processing infrastructure which
generates our proprietary map data files from various data sources (HERE and
OSM).

We need another developer to work on the SDK which is written in C++ with
many third-party dependencies. The SDK and the work has the following areas:

- Reading cartographical data from our proprietary format
- Asynchronous data processing
- Generating visualized map data for the OpenGL
- Handling user inputs
- Routing
- Integrating custom user data (GDAL/OGR formats)
- Address and POI database, queries
- Build system, deployment, API, documentation
- C#/Java/C bindings
- Platform-specific issues (iOS/Android/WinRT)
